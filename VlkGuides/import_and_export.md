# Getting Started 02: Import & Export

## Import your assets
Valkyrie Engine allows you to import Meshes, Rigs, Animation and Maps (Texture, Alphas, Etc.) to build your own applications.  

The Current Version supports these formats:  
**.dae** (Collada), **FBX**, **.Obj**, **.Ply**, **.STL**, **.3DS**, **.IFC**, **.scene** and **.ach**.  

### Import Step 01
Within Valkyrie, select the **File Explorer** icon from the **Library panel** to open the Data Folder of your current project.

### Import Step 02 
Drag any files and assets you want to use in your project in the Data Folder you just opened (Texture, 3D Mesh, Rigs, Etc.).  

### Import Step 03
To review all the imported assets within Valkyrie, select the **File Explorer** icon within the **Library panel**. All of your imported files will appear here.

Tips: You can refresh the Library tab by clicking on the **Refresh Icon** beside the **File Explorer Icon**.  

## Export your project

### Export modes
Within Valkyrie, you have 3 different export settings to choose from:  

* Exe File  
This Exe mode allows you to generate a Microsoft **Windows Executable file**. As all EXE files, it will run smoothly on any Windows machine, without the need for any other software install.  

* Player File  
Use Player mode to generate a VPK file that can be played on any mobile devices with our app [We3D](https://www.talansoft.com/vlk/downloads#we3d), but also on all **Mac / Windows** computers where the **Valkyrie** software installed.  

* Project File  
Use Project mode to generate a **compressed Archive** (.zip file) of your entire project that can be easily transferred, opened & edited by other users.  

### Export Step 01
On the top left corner of Valkyrie, in the **Center** tab and the **Tools** section, select the **Publish Application** Button.
