## Export your project

### Export modes
Within Valkyrie, you have 3 different export settings to choose from:  

* Exe File
This mode allows you to generate a Microsoft Windows Executable file. As all exe files, it will run smoothly on any Windows machine, without the need for any other software install.  

* Player File
Use Player mode to generate a VPK file that can be played on any mobile devices with our app [We3D](https://www.talansoft.com/vlk/downloads#we3d), but also on all Mac / Windows computers where the **Valkyrie** software installed.  

* Project File
Use Project mode to generate a compressed Archive (.zip file) of your entire project that can be easily transferred, opened & edited by other users.  

### Export Step 01
