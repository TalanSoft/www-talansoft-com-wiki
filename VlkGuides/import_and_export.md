# Export
Within Valkyrie, you have 3 different kind of export setting to choose from.

##### Exe File 
* This method is to create an application version of the entire project. This application can then be played on any device without issue. 

##### Player Level File
* This method creates a file version of a specific level. However unlike **Exe Export**, you require the Valkyrie Software itself to open the Level File. 

##### Project File 
* This method allows you to compressed your entire project file. Drastically reducing the file size for the ease of file transfer.
