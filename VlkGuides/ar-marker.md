# How to use an AR Marker
We often want to position an **augmented reality** scene on a specific location identified by a physical marker like a QR code. We propose to show you how in this tutorial.  

## Basic display mode
First of all, you are probably used to scanning your environment to find an anchor as shown in this video. This is the basic display mode for most augmented reality scenes:

## Standard Valkyrie setup
Now, if you want to avoid scanning the environment and want your scene to be displayed at a specific location, you should know that all VPK files created with Valkyrie and played on our mobile platform [We3D](https://www.talansoft.com/vlk/downloads#we3d) will respond to the following Valkyrie QR code:

Print that QR code or display it on a screen, and your augmented reality scene will anchor on it right away as shown in this video:
