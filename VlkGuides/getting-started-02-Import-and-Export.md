# Import
Valkyrie Engine allows you to import any Mesh, Rigs, Animation and Maps (Texture, Alphas, Etc.). 

The Current Version supports this formats
**.dae** (Collada), **FBX**, **.Obj**, **.Ply**, **.STL**, **.3DS**, **.IFC** and **.ach**.

### Step 01 
With the Current version of Valkyrie, to import any assets, you must first search the project file of the individual Valkyrie Project inside your folder.
Look for the **Data** Folder and place all and any assets you wish to add for that said project (Texture, 3D Mesh, Rigs, Etc.) 

###Step 02
Within Valkyrie, select the File Explorer Icon within the Library tab. All of your imported data will appear here.

Tips: You can refresh the Library tab by back in and out of different tabs.
