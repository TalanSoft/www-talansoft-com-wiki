| I get the following security popup from Windows when I run the installer program: "Do you want to allow this app from an unknown editor to make changes to your device". What should I do? |
| ------ |
| This message is normal as we still need to process the paperwork with Microsoft to become a registered developer. This is not on our priority list for the moment. Rest assured that our app does not contain any malware. |
