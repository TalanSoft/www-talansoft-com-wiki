| **I get the following security popup from Windows when I run the installer program: "Do you want to allow this app from an unknown editor to make changes to your device". What should I do?** |
| ------ |
| This message is normal as we still need to process the paperwork with Microsoft to become a registered developer. This is not on our priority list for the moment. Rest assured that our app does not contain any malware. |  

| **What filename extensions do you use?** |
| ------ |
| .vlk extension, is your project file you can edit in Valkyrie editor. |
| .vpk extension, is your compiled executable file that can be run if Valkyrie editor is installed on your computer, or with the We3D iOS app on mobile. |
| .exe extension, is your compiled executable file that can be run on any Windows computer (in Valkyrie editor you can choose between exporting your project as a vpk or an exe). |

| **Which executable should I use to run Valkyrie?** |
| ------ |
| On most recent computers, the processors are 64-bit. You should then run the x64 version. |
| If your system is 32-bit, you should run the x86 version. |
