# Frequently Asked Questions

| **What filename extensions do you use?** |
| ------ |
| .vlk extension, is your project file you can edit in Valkyrie editor. |
| .vpk extension, is your compiled executable file that can be run if Valkyrie editor is installed on your computer, or with the We3D iOS app on mobile. |
| .exe extension, is your compiled executable file that can be run on any Windows computer (in Valkyrie editor you can choose between exporting your project as a vpk or an exe). |

| **Which executable should I use to install Valkyrie?** |
| ------ |
| On most recent computers, the processors are 64-bit. You should then run the x64 version. |
| If your system is 32-bit, you should run the x86 version. |

| **I have noticed this message when I try to open the zipped vlk file of a template I downloaded from your website** ![image](uploads/458ba03920075b29c55c6e4061d2a5c0/image.png) |
| ------ |
| Like all applications, vlk files need to be unzipped in order to be run :p |


| **Do I need to save my assets (3d models, textures...) in the Documents/User/VlkProjects folder?** |
| ------ |
| You need to save your assets in the same folder as your Valkyrie project folder. That is the good practice we recommend in order to compile your application faster. |

| **I have purchased a license however the free version watermark is still displayed on my exported projects. What gives?** |
| ------ |
| A common mistake is that you did not paste your token correctly in the export panel. Make sure that you did not insert any space before or after the token. |
