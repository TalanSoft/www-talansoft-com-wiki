# Frequently Asked Questions

## What filename extensions do you use?
- .vlk extension, is your project file you can edit in Valkyrie editor.
- .vpk extension, is your compiled executable file that can be run if Valkyrie editor is installed on your computer, or with the We3D iOS app on mobile.
- .exe extension, is your compiled executable file that can be run on any Windows computer (in Valkyrie editor you can choose between exporting your project as a vpk or an exe).

##  I have purchased a license however the free version watermark is still displayed on my exported projects. What gives?
- A common mistake is that you did not paste your token correctly in the export panel. Make sure that you did not insert any space before or after the token.
