* How to interact with the presentation? Example: WASD to move around, right click + mouse move to look around. Click start to start the game.
* How to use the template? Example: once youâ€™re Valkyrie, how to you start and maybe what can you do with it, like hmmm, change the score, background whatever.
* (Optional) How did we make this from scratch.
