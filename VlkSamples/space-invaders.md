# Space Invaders Valkyrie Template

Here is a template targeted at beginners and intermediate Valkyrie users. It is loosely based off of the classic arcade game, Space Invaders. This template is a complete beginning to end game that has splash screens, title screen, level progression, enemy types, player 1up, high score tracking, basic player controls, win/lose screens and credits screen.
