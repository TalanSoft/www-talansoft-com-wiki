**1)**  * Click on the **Export** tab and select the file format & location you wish to export to.

**2)** * Use *Player* to generate a **VPK** file that can be played on iOS devices with our app **We3D**, but also on all Mac / Windows computers that have Valkyrie Engine software installed.

**3)** * In this case we will use the *Player* option as we want to create an AR scene for iOS.

**4)** Options to upload to your IOS Devices 

For Online Transfer:

* Upload the VPK file to your preferred online storage service, or send it to anyone by email or any messaging app.
* Download the VPK on your iOS device and select **Open in We3D**.
