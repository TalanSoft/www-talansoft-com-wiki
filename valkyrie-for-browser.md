The web player can run vpk properly with the following browsers:
* macOS: Safari, Firefox, Chrome  
* Windows: Firefox, Chrome, Edge (the new Webkit based version)  
* Linux: Firefox & Chrome  
* iOS: Safari, Firefox, Chrome
* Android: Firefox  

What we know doesn't work:
- Internet Explorer - any version
- Chrome on Android tablet
- there is no video decoding in the webplayer, so your video in a vpk will not play
