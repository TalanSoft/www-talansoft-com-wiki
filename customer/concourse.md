## Business Case Description
Travel retail display company Concourse was looking for a way to assist sales people in proposing their booth rental services (whether it is for a pop-up store implementation, an event stall, or frequent shopping environment changes required for brand activation).  
The idea was to find a solution in order to help customers get the sizing and feeling of how a booth would look like in their environment, and assist them in picking the right accessories and colors for their rental booth.  

## What Valkyrie enabled
After an introductory workshop to Valkyrie, Concourse was able to ship a 3D booth configurator in a few days (including the 3D asset design) which assists salesmen to showcase their product by configuring the following elements in real-time:  
- Booth frame color
- Infill panels color
- Light fixture type: modern, rattan, industrial
- Equipment: oven, fridge, cash register, coffee machine, consumables

Have a peek into a few of the combinations made available:  
- Coffee shop

## Results
Thanks to Valkyrie, Concourse achieved its business goals. The company was able to:
- Rapidly obtain a 3D configurator that now goes everywhere with Concourse sales persons, as an app developed in Valkyrie is natively available on any smartphone or tablet.  
- Help sales people shorten their sales cycle.
- Increase customers' satisfaction by managing their expectations regarding the end-products they will receive.  
- Enable frequent changes in-house, as the ease of use of Valkyrie lets Concourse local design team update the app in a few hours to fit new models, colors or fixtures...
