## Business Case Description
Many businesses in F&B, the event industry or Travel Retail use booth rental services.  
The issue our client, Concourse, who provides these rental services had, was to help his customers get the sizing and feeling of how a booth would look like in their environment, and assist them in picking the right accessories and colors for their rental booth.  

## What Valkyrie enabled
After an introductory workshop to Valkyrie, Concourse was able to ship a 3D booth configurator 

You can showcase the product to customers by configuring the following elements in real-time:  
- Booth frame color
- Infill panels color
- Light fixture type: modern, rattan, industrial
- Equipment: oven, fridge, cash register, coffee machine, consumables

Find below a few combinations possible:  
- Coffee shop

## Results
Since an app developed in Valkyrie is natively available on any smartphone or tablet, the 3D configurator now goes everywhere with Concourse sales persons.  
The app helps sales people shorten the sales cycle and increase customers' satisfaction by managing their expectations regarding the end-products they will receive.  
Whether it is for a pop-up store implementation, an event stall, or frequent shopping environment changes required for brand activation, Concourse local design team can update the app in a few hours to fit new models, colors or fixtures. All is made in-house.
