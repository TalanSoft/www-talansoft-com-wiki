# Concourse Success Story - 3D Booth Configurator


## Business Case Description
Many businesses in F&B, the event industry or Travel Retail use booth rental services.  
The issue one client who provides these rental services had, was to help his customers get the sizing and feeling of how a booth would look like in their environment, and assist them in picking the right accessories and colours for their rental booth.  
After an introductory workshop to Valkyrie, our client was able to ship a 3D booth configurator that helped him shorten his sales cycle and increase his customers' satisfaction by managing their expectations regarding the products.  
Whether it is for a pop-up store implementation, an event stall, or frequent shopping environment changes required for brand activation, the 3D configurator goes everywhere with the sales persons thanks in their smartphone or tablet.
