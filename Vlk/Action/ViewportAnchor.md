# ViewportAnchor

Moves the targeted entity to the edge of the viewport.

-   **on\_update**: Whether the target entity is anchored every time the
    action is updated.
-   **anchor\_h**: Where the anchor the target entity horizontally.
-   **anchor\_v**: Where the anchor the target entity vertically.

NOTE: This is especially useful to build a UI, it allows you to simply
stick parts of a user interface to a side of the viewport no matter what
its aspect ratio is - so that your UI is fully resolution independant.
