# LoadLevel

The LoadLevel action can be used to load an exisiting level into a Layer
of the level you are currently using.

Target: The Layer that you want the level to be loaded in to. Level: The
name of the level you want to load, without the extention.

Note: If the LoadLevel action is repeatedly triggered, it will replace
the target layer's content.
