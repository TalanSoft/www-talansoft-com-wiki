# MessageBox

The MessageBox action is used mostly for testing simple logic in your
application or game and makes it easier to debug the initial setup once
you hit the play button. When the MessageBox action is triggered it pops
up a message box that has a title and your text inside it. ie:
MessageBox can be used on your player to test if collision is working.
When an enemy shoots your player you can have it trigger the message box
to pop up "Ouch! I got shot! :( " Once you know that the collision is
working correctly you can continue intergating the other mechanics.
*CAUTION*: If you trigger the MessageBox action a lot of times at once..
you will have a lot of boxes to close.

-   **Title**: The name of the popup box

<!-- -->

-   **Text**: What you want it to say inside the popup box.
