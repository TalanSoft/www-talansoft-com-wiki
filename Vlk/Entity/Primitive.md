# Primitive

-   **draw**: Whether the solid primitive should be drawn. Turning this
    off is useful to build trigger area or collision only objects.
-   **outline**: Whether to draw an outline around the primitive. The
    outline uses the material's *Opacity* color.
-   **wireframe**: Whether the primitive's wireframe should be drawn.
-   **physics**: Whether to create a physics collision primitive.
-   **type**: The primitive's type.
-   **slices**: The number of slices / horizontal resolution of the
    primitive. A higher value generate a more precise shape but uses
    more polygons.
-   **stacks**: The number of stacks / vertical resolution of the
    primitive. A higher value generate a more precise shape but uses
    more polygons.
-   **inner\_size**: Percentage of the size of the solid primitive when
    drawn with an outline.
-   **mass**: If not zero, specifies the primitive's rigid body mass used
    in a Dynamics simulation.
