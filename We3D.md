## How to Download a Valkyrie Scene?

A Valkyrie Scene uses the VPK file extension. There are multiple ways to send a VPK to your iOS devices.

### Downloading from a website or from another iOS app

- Use a link given to you by someone else, or upload your VPK file to your preferred online storage service.
- Download it on your iOS device using Safari and select **Open in We3D**.

Use any app's share/open into feature and select "Copy to We3D" or "Open in We3D" while sharing a VPK file.

### Transferring from a computer using a web browser

- While connected to a Wi-Fi network, open We3D on your iOS Device.
- Click on the menu on the top-right corner.
