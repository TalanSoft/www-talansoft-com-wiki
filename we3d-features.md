# We3D

- We3D can be downloaded for free by anyone on the App Store and is used to read on iOS any application created with Valkyrie Engine in a *vpk* format. It can be used to test out the applications you created on iOS before turning them into standalone mobile apps, or to distribute your application to your own customers.
- Think of a *vpk* file as a PowerPoint file, you can redistribute it in the same manner. We3D is the application you use to read the file on mobile devices.
- On a side note, on desktop you can publish directly in an *exe* format for Windows or use the Valkyrie Player which is bundled with the free download of Valkyrie to read the *vpk*.
