FBX or DAE for animated & static assets.
OBJ is also an option for static assets.
JPG, PNG or TGA for textures (It is recommended to set a maximum texture resolution of 2048x2048px).

- If you save your scene using `CTRL+S` the changes made to the level you are working on will be saved without creating a new level.

- You have also the possibility to save your scene incrementally using `Cmd+Shift+S / CTRL+SHIFT+S`. A new level will then be created.
